Here are the basics of using Git for this project (make sure you're in your Prompt-Me
folder and use "git status" to see that you don't get a "fatal: Not a get repository"
error)!

* Any lines that are indented refer to a line you want to write on the bash terminal

To pull my changes (ALWAYS DO THIS BEFORE PUSHING YOUR CHANGES OR WHEN YOU RETURN TO
WORKING):

  git pull

To add your changes and save them so I can see them:
  git add YOUR_FILE_PATH(S)
  git commit -m "YOUR MESSAGE"
  git push

Voila! :) Ping Melissa if you have any questions!
